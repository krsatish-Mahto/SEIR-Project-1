 Project statement:
program to take two URLs from the web on the command line, print how 
many bits are common in their simhashes.
Count the frequency of every word (a word is a sequence of alphanumeric characters, 
case does NOT matter) in the 
body of your document
○ Write a 64 bit hash function for a word using 
polynomial rolling hash function
○ Here s[i] is the ASCII for letter i in a word, use p = 53 and m = 264
○ Compute Simhash for the document
